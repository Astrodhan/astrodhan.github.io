        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>This report describes my personal experience with the Duolingo Spanish (from English) course, covering my study methods, time calculations, self-assessment of Spanish proficiency, reflections on grammar, and commentary on the course's structure. The document details three distinct phases of my study routine and offers insights into the practical aspects of language learning.</p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>I completed the Spanish (from English) course on a program called Duolingo. The equivalent level in CEFR is B2. I am able to speak Spanish now. I will share my technique, my experience and other general comments. I hope this helps.</p>
    <p>From here I will assume that the reader is acquainted with Duolingo.</p>
    <p>I completed the program today and my daily streak stands at 375. I started my study in late December of 2023 and finished it in mid January of 2025. The questions regarding my abilities in Spanish shall be answered later.</p>
    <p>The 375 days is misleading as all the days were not all equivalent. There were three phases.</p>

    <h3>Phase 1</h3>
    <p>For the first four months, I did one exercise a day in order to maintain my streak. I often missed days and used streak freezes. This is what most users do, however I still learned faster than others because I only did the first bubble and a story before skipping to the next unit.</p>
    <p>I realised that the exercises are repetitive after the first bubble (having 5-6 exercises) and I would not be learning anything new. Hence, I would skip to the next unit. I would discuss the efficacy of this method shortly.</p>

    <h3>Phase 2</h3>
    <p>Around May I started doing Duolingo at the same time of the day everyday. That was around 5AM-6AM in the morning. I wake up at 5AM everyday, even on weekends and on special days. This consistency was a game-changer.</p>

    <h2>Time Calculations</h2>
    <p>At my first phase speed... (content continues)</p>

    <h2>Can I Speak Spanish?</h2>
    <p>Now, to answer the most important question, can I speak Spanish?</p>
    <p>The answer is: Absolutely. I can.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>I can understand Spanish dubbed <em>Friends</em> (a US TV show) without subtitles...</li>
        <!-- List items continue -->
    </ul>

    <p><em>(Note: The Spanish paragraph has many errors.)</em></p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Duolingo is a great resource for learning Spanish. I would make some improvements but it's highly util as it is.</p>
