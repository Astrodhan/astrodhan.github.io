<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">I looked at my
basket full of groceries and thought “Oh wow now I am fully an
adult.”. 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">I took a picture and
sent it to Lisa, a 22 year old moscowite. It was my first week in
Moscow, and a stranger from the internet was my only friend here. 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">Lisa was severly
disappointed that I was taking pride in doing something so basic. As
I  would slowly discover, 16 years olds lived completely
independently here. A 22 year old grown ass adult wowing at a basket
of groceries was a major turn-off.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">What was I supposed
to tell her? That I had never cooked full-time for myself until now?
I told her to never mind instead and slipped out of that topic like
an oiled rabbit through a brass ring.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">Or could I say, “Oh
I am just from a different culture”. Moscow 2021 was a strange
post-feminist Russia, while the India I had just come from was
pre-feminist.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">I took my groceries,
and headed for my hostel. 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">The roads were wide
and clean. It was the beginning of the spring</p>
