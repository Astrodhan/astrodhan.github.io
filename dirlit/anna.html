        <b>Date: </b> April 2021.
        <b>Content warning:</b> Strong profanity, I personally never speak like this.<br><br>
	"Behave yourself!" yelled Vasiliy.<br>
"Yelling at walls is not going to help you, stop being an attention whore" Anya snapped. <br>
"I know she can hear me, I very well know that she can. BITCH I WANT TO GO TO WORK!" He yelled again, this time into an air duct.<br>
<br>
The passengers in the Moscow underground metropolitan transport grunted as the escalators refused to move. They were standing still on the escalator.<br>
<br>
"Come on already!" Vasiliy jumped  on his step in anger.<br>
"Bro shut the fuck up and have some patience." a teenager quipped from ten steps above Vasiliy and Anya.<br>
<br>
"She does it on purpose, you all know it!" Vasiliy said while putting up his middle finger against the wall.<br>
<br>
"If you don't calm down I'm punching you in the gut" Anya said.<br>
"I don't know why you are all so soft on her, or maybe you're afraid she will kill you all one day" Vasiliy spoke to Anya in an angry voice.<br>
<br>
Before Anya could reply, the escalators started moving again and ANNA spoke from the speakers in the ceiling "Dear passengers, I'm so sorry for the halting. Please resume your ride. There was a power failure in Georgia and ANTIPIN couldn't handle it on his own."<br>
<br>
As usual the passengers didn't wait to hear the explanation and rushed towards the rails. When the doors of the train closed, Vasiliy restarted his bitching.
<br>
"Do you really buy her bullshit?" He said.<br>
"Dude, power failures are common. What do you want me to say?" Anya replied, "ask ANTIPIN yourself if you want to."<br>
"Oh I will" Vasiliy replied, pulling back his wrist sleeves and pulling out his phone.<br>
"STOP ASKING ANNA FOR HELP EVERYTIME YOU FAIL AT YOUR JOB" He texted ANTIPIN.<br>
<br>
"Fucker is leaving me on seen" said Vasiliy.<br>
"Anyone would, look at your text!" Anya said angrily.<br>
"He says he's sorry and that he had tried asking the air traffic controller first." a middle aged man sitting next to the duo read from his phone loudly.<br>
<br>
"There. Now sit quietly." Anya said to Vasiliy and dug her nails into his thigh. Vasiliy wanted to continue but he kept quiet through rest of their ride. <br>
<br>
<br>
"So sorry for the inconvenience" ANNA's hologram said politely to Anya at the exit gate. "And I'm sorry for my boyfriend's abuses" replied Anya. <br> 
"I will apologise to him personally." replied ANNA.<br>
<br>
When Vasiliy tried to go through an exit, the doors jammed again. "Anya! Look she's doing it on purpose!" He yelled at his girlfriend standing on the other side of the glass.<br>
<br>
"You're a self centred ass Vasiliy, if I hear this bullshit conspiracy theory again I'm slapping you." Anya flipped him off and started walking towards the subway exit.<br>
<br>
The doors started working again. <br>
"Please forgive me for the inconvenience, the doors should work now" ANNA told everyone through the speakers.<br>
<br>
"I know you do it just to fuck with us, others might believe you but I know you." Vasiliy accused the door hologram as he walked through it.<br>
<br>
<br>
"And what are you going to do about it, bitch-boy?" The hologram winked.<br>
