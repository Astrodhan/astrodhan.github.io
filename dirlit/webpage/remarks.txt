We report the discovery of 10 new variable stars, discovered from the data extracted from the photographic plates borrowed from the Moscow Photographic Plate Collection (Samus, N. N. et al 2005).
We borrowed from the archive 127 plates centering around the coordinates 22:40:00 +54:00:00 taken by the German-made astrograph at the Sternberg Astronomical Institute's Crimean observatory. These astrophotographs were taken between 1983 and 1996. The telescope was a refractor telescope with a focal length of 160cm and an aperture of 40cm. The photographic plates are squares with a side length of 30cm. They correspond to the "B" region in the Johnson-Morgan scheme. The field of view for these photographs is 10deg x 10deg.  The exposure time is 45 minutes. The limiting magnitude of these plates is 17m to 18m.

The plates were scanned with the help of Epson Expression 11000XL scanner at SAI at 2400dpi resolution, processed, aligned and stacked. The scanned image-stack was further broken into roughly 100 sub-fields.  Each sub-field contained up to 127 data points for hundreds of stars. Each sub-field was analysed manually through the use of software named VaST (Variability Search Toolkit) (Sokolovsky, K. V. et al 2018). Candidates for variable stars were shortlisted, a search through the General Catalogue of Variable Stars (Samus N.N. et al 2023) and the International Variable Star Index (Watson, C. L. et al 2006) was conducted and 17 previously unknown variable stars were brought forward out of thousands of stars that were analysed. These discoveries were confirmed by looking up Zwicky Transient Facility (Eric C. Bellm et al 2019) data on SNAD web tool (Malenchev K.2023), bringing the total to 10. 

We referred to Antipin et al (2018) for the technique. We used "Online Period Search Service" created by Kirill Sokolovsky and hosted by SAI for calculating the periodograms and phased light-curves. This research has made use of "Aladin sky atlas" developed at CDS, Strasbourg Observatory, France to obtain the GAIA survey names (Bonnarel et al 2000).
