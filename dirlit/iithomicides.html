    Dear friends,<br>
<br>
I do not want to pretend this email will ever reach you through the official means.<br>
But I know at least one person will read it before it is deleted. That is sufficient.<br>
Copy it before deleting, please.<br>
If you are a student rep (sorry not been keeping track of the elections so idk who is SGS rn), please pass it on to students. You WILL save a life.<br>
<br>
So how did we get to IIT?<br>
We studied 8 hours a day without a gap for 3 years straight. Some of you studied for 6 or more.<br>
We studied undergraduate syllabus for JEE.<br>
But JEE was just the beginning, the competition extended inside IIT.<br>
<br>
The first ever lecture I had in IIT was a terrible experience for me.<br>
I was a bright 17 year old extremely enthusiastic about physics who was sitting on the first bench.<br>
But I could not understand what was happening. Somehow everyone else was understanding it.<br>
<br>
I got an E in maths in the first semester. I had never had anything but 100% marks in maths till date (not in JEE of course, but to even ask those problems to 17 year olds is cruelty).<br>
Had I suddenly turned stupid?<br>
<br>
But what is this E grade anyway?<br>
I had no idea what a grade is.<br>
But let us examine what a grade means. Grade literally means darja, your quality.<br>
So apparently I was the lowest of approvable quality.<br>
But was IIT serious?<br>
Relative grading means that there will always be E grade students.<br>
That means IIT makes E grade students by its function. <br>
They made me E grade. I was S grade when I came (do I need to give proof?).<br>
<br>
Why do we need to be graded?<br>
<br>
Because at the end there is a slave auction (yes) and the buyers would like to know which maal to buy. That's it. 5 pointers exist to scare 7 pointers who exist to scare 9 pointers.<br>
Because 5 pointer is a death sentence, everybody knows that.<br>
<br>
Is that a joke? Are you saying that some students will necessarily be of low grade? <br>
<br>
IIT wastes 90% of the students’ potential to sell the topmost maal to wealthiest most corrupt people of the world who won’t even learn your name.<br>
<br>
IIT could have nurtured me. I sacrificed so much to qualify for their love. Instead IIT took the thing closest to my heart, physics, and said I don't deserve to study it. I was still not worthy of their affection after JEE. They would only talk to me if I played this game and did well at it.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
I think the professor I had for maths is a really nice person and I respect him a lot; but he did not need to teach! I shared class with CS people who had already studied the syllabus. And others who were trying to BC.<br>
<br>
<br>
Anyway, throughout my stay at IIT I felt like killing myself. To this, IIT’s response was that I must have some medical condition. Yes, I had a disease called capitalism.<br>
Are you jokers or what? That somehow all suicidal people of the country decide to choose IIT? If you want I can calculate the odds using suicide statistics (actually I will do that).<br>
<br>
No, you make us suicidal. <br>
It is not ‘sui’cide. It is homicide.<br>
<br>
Even 1 student homicide should have called for a complete revolution in educational methods in a socialist institution. India is a socialist country, correct? So why is IIT so anti-national?<br>
Is there anything more anti-national than killing 3 people every year to sell students to slaveowners? <br>
<br>
IITs could have changed this country. All of us want to improve the lives of the people around us. Together we are so smart we can end hunger in India in a few years (that won’t happen because hunger is another E grade needed to scare workers into working a shitty job which does not help the country in any way.) theoretically.<br>
<br>
When there were so many suicides we went to IIT and asked admin for an in depth survey from Indian Psychiatric Association. We had to struggle so much to get this simple thing approved. It did not happen. <br>
And 6 months later a bright student from HSS, who had topped the entrance exam died in IITM. She could have been our prime minister one day. <br>
But they changed nothing after that! Just the frequency of their “feeling depressed” advertisements for a shitty counselling service increased.<br>
It was an explicit message that 1 or 2 lives did not matter to them so much.<br>
When we went to the administration to talk to the director, he tried running away from the back exit. We stopped his car, and he started yelling at us. He refused to talk with us. We were dying and he did not care. Our comrades had to sit on a hunger strike to get IIT to take us seriously. IIT did agree to talk after this, but none of the demands we made (probe into her death, mental health survey) were ever met.<br>
And we had homicides last year also, how shameful that we had to find out from newspapers. IITM has also buried one death that is not in reports. In my third year a student from mechanical engineering left IIT, and later he was found dead in AP.  He is the sixth homicide from that infamous year. Officially the newspapers say that IIT has informed them that he is back and studying. Yes, this is true. <br>
<br>
Now after this (the secret of the sixth homicide) they will want to target me, but I don’t care even if they don’t give me those two pieces of paper. I don’t need them.<br>
<br>
Why couldn’t I say all of this earlier?<br>
Because I had stakes in the game. I was trying to be a researcher in Germany. <br>
Today my german professor (for whom I have been working for free (sorry not for free, to be the 23rd name in a shit paper)) revealed that it is futile to try again to get into Max Planck. I did do an internship there. But why was i disqualified? Because they demanded to see what grade I am. And IIT would happily condense my entire being into a number.<br>
I loved working on my thesis and did a beautiful job at producing a project report in variable stars. I even got an S for it. But since I did badly in advanced physics courses I never asked for I am disqualified from astronomy according to the german unis.<br>
<br>
Those who know me know that physics and astronomy are the only things I live for, but I was told by this German university that I am not qualified to be a minimum wage worker and a second class citizen. They told me I am not motivated enough, what a joke. Most of their grad students leave science, so they are a complete joke at selecting “motivated” candidates.<br>
<br>
They did not tell me I am not motivated, of course. You see, what they are doing is an algorithmic selection of the most competitive students. They bullshit with their commitments to women and people from the global south, what they are actually looking for are exploitable people.<br>
Who else will calculate the exoplanet mass detection limits for minimum wage?<br>
<br>
They are also extremely disrespectful to us when it comes to immigration. I had to submit 24 documents proving I am not a thief or a terrorist to be a minimum wage worker for 2 months. <br>
<br>
I also went to Russia this year for science, and I only needed a printout of an invitation letter, my passport and a photograph to get a humanitarian science visa. I did not even need to buy flight tickets. I did not need to tell them where I was living. Why would I have to? I never posed a threat to them, in fact my presence only made their country slightly happier (because I loved someone there).<br>
This is not because speaking Russian suddenly makes you a good person, this is because of USSR.<br>
<br>
So am I not going to do a PhD anymore?<br>
First of all, the highest qualification in physics is MSc. I can’t get a higher degree if I wanted to. I am already a ‘real ‘physicist.<br>
“Doctorate in Philosophy in astronomy” is a joke.<br>
I do want to do a PhD, but not on those random ass topics; I want to put together dialectical materialism and the second law of thermodynamics. Presently no one is doing that. Physicists, despite their doctorate in philosophy are illiterate about dialectical materialism.<br>
<br>
They are selling these bogus degrees. I mean, currently in philosophy dialectical materialism is the hottest topic, but it is not taught in any universities of the capitalist world. How am I supposed to take all these “doctors of philosophy” seriously when they cannot tell me why we have forgotten Hegel but remember Marx? <br>
<br>
Dialectical materialism is also known as science, but they never teach you it. This is exactly what the British schools did to us. They don’t really educate you, they wait for you to train a group of neurons in your head to do a very specialised task for the cheapest price.<br>
Socialism is not up for debate, it cannot be, because socialism seeks the good for all people. But the good for all the people is bad for some people who happen to be in power. <br>
<br>
Honestly if I did not study philosophy in college I would have led a life of pain or died by suicide.<br>
<br>
So if you are considering death, simply leave IIT. Your family won’t let you, then leave them too.<br>
YOU ARE NOT DEPRESSED. Some of us may be. I know it because now I feel happy after 5 years, a feeling I thought I did not want. In fourth year I  told my friends I will never turn 30. But I tell you today that I will turn 150.<br>
<br>
Trust me, you do not need IIT to be whatever you wish to become and do. IIT will waste your potential. You are a very intelligent person. In the book, Rancho was a 5 pointer, that was the whole point of the book. Making rancho a topper is the exact problem the film needed to address. What a waste.<br>
If you don’t have anywhere to go, reach out to me, I have a place, you can stay here until you figure out what is next. <br>
<br>
I don’t think I will ever want to die now. I never wanted to die. I was trying to kill this body I was living in. I was going to be a murderer just to stop the pain.<br>
<br>
I feel so free now. I danced on the streets today. I am free. I finally understand Chandrashekhar Azad. I legit don’t care if they kill me like they killed Bhagat Singh, Che Guevara or Thomas Sankara. I understand now what is meant by “shoot me, you will only kill a man”.<br>
<br>
You cannot be free if you are in the capitalist system.<br>
Even if you are not trying to kill self, you are hurting. You may need therapy, drugs, sacrifices or other coping mechanisms. No amount of therapy will stop your surplus being stolen from you.<br>
Study alienation by Marx, save your life.<br>
<br>
You are important. Live, people will love you and support you. This country does not want IITians to die. One day you can be the reason for the happiness of millions of people. Opt out of the squid game.<br>
<br>
Nothing will change after this email, I know that. I have nothing to prove, I am sending this text to save a life. It does not matter who I am. What I have said are impersonal material facts. <br>
<br>
You do not need to do anything for a living. You can continue living by sitting still. <br>
You don’t *have* to do anything. Only do what you *want* to do. <br>
Freedom is your birthright.<br>
<br>
With love,<br>
A comrade.<br>
