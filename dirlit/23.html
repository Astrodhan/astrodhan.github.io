<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;line-height: 100%;text-align: center;">On turning 23.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;line-height: 100%;text-align: center;"><br></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;line-height: 100%;text-align: center;">On a beautiful cool morning three young men were walking on stone paved path lit by golden sunlight. The trees were glistening in bright colours of vasanta. These men carried the charge of treason and conspiracy against the Windsor family.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;line-height: 100%;text-align: center;"><br></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;line-height: 100%;text-align: center;">The three men climbed the colonial gallows and waited for their time of execution. When offered the final opium of religious sermon, Bhagat denied it.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;line-height: 100%;text-align: center;">He was calm. The executioners felt uneasy about his composure and the strength of his nerves.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;line-height: 100%;text-align: center;"><br></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;line-height: 100%;text-align: center;">When his execution by hanging was announced, several people tried to convince him to beg for mercy. He instead insisted that he had waged war on imperialism and deserved to be executed like a prisoner of war: by being shot to death.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;line-height: 100%;text-align: center;">People then tried to convince him that he should accept God so his death won&rsquo;t be as painful. This offended him greatly, he felt misunderstood. In response he wrote the essay &ldquo;Why am I an Atheist&rdquo;.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;line-height: 100%;text-align: center;"><br></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;line-height: 100%;text-align: center;">He writes, and I quote:</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;line-height: 100%;text-align: center;">&ldquo;Within a week it is to be pronounced. What is the consolation with the exception of the idea that I am going to sacrifice my life for a cause? A God-believing Hindu might be expecting to be reborn as a king, a Muslim or a Christian might dream of the luxuries to be enjoyed in paradise and the reward he is to get for his suffering and sacrifices. But, what am I to expect? I know the moment the rope is fitted around my neck and rafters removed under my feet, that will be the last moment. I, or to be more precise, my soul, as interpreted in the metaphysical terminology shall all be finished there. Nothing further. A short life of struggle with no such magnificent end, shall in itself be the reward, if I have the courage to take it in that light. That is all. With no selfish motive or desire to be awarded here or hereafter, quite disinterestedly, have I devoted my life to the cause of independence, because I could not do otherwise. The day we find a great number of men and women with this psychology, who cannot devote themselves to anything else than the service of mankind and emancipation of the suffering humanity, that day shall inaugurate the era of liberty.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;line-height: 100%;text-align: center;"><br></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;line-height: 100%;text-align: center;">After they were executed, the imperialists took their bodies and secretly disposed them off. They burnt the bodies and threw away the pieces in the river. They were scared of him, even when he was nothing but charcoal and ash.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;line-height: 100%;text-align: center;"><br></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;line-height: 100%;text-align: center;">All three of them were 23.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;line-height: 100%;text-align: center;">Tomorrow I turn 23.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;line-height: 100%;text-align: center;"><br></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;line-height: 100%;text-align: center;">I am no longer a child. At this age these boys had been revolutionaries for over half a decade. They studied in college and organised at night. They went around the country spreading class-awareness, fighting division sowed by imperialism. They saw that the people of their motherland were being exploited to their bones and they could not sleep at night.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;line-height: 100%;text-align: center;"><br></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;line-height: 100%;text-align: center;">What has changed? Yes we no longer pay taxes to the Windsor family, but did the British take imperialism back with them? No.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;line-height: 100%;text-align: center;">Imperialism is not about foreign rule, it is about exploitation of powerless people. What difference does it make if the name of the one who exploits people is Indian? And it was never just about India. People worldwide are being crushed by imperialism. The struggle is internationalist, not nationalist.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;line-height: 100%;text-align: center;"><br></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;line-height: 100%;text-align: center;">As I write this a child somewhere in this country, living in a shed under a construction site is dying of hunger and malaria.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;line-height: 100%;text-align: center;">As I write this, aadivasis are being forced out of their homes. Their forests are being devoured by capitalists for minerals.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;line-height: 100%;text-align: center;">As I write this, a farmer is tying a noose around his neck not very far from me because he could not pay his debt to the landlord.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;line-height: 100%;text-align: center;">As I write this a man is diving into human extreta in the sewers naked and without protection, he will die of diseases he contracts from this work.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;line-height: 100%;text-align: center;"><br></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;line-height: 100%;text-align: center;">Capitalism has turned this country into a dystopia. Half of Mumbai&rsquo;s population lives in slums. People lay on footpaths with nothing in their stomachs but cheap liquor while the richest of us drive past them in their expensive German vehicles.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;line-height: 100%;text-align: center;"><br></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;line-height: 100%;text-align: center;">Lenin said &ldquo;During the lifetime of great revolutionaries, the oppressing classes constantly hounded them, received their theories with the most savage malice, the most furious hatred and the most unscrupulous campaigns of lies and slander. After their death, attempts are made to convert them into harmless icons, to canonize them, so to say, and to hallow their names to a certain extent for the &ldquo;consolation&rdquo; of the oppressed classes and with the object of duping the latter, while at the same time robbing the revolutionary theory of its substance, blunting its revolutionary edge and vulgarizing it.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;line-height: 100%;text-align: center;"><br></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;line-height: 100%;text-align: center;">When he lived they called him a terrorist, when he died they called him a nationalist.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;line-height: 100%;text-align: center;">He was neither. His real ideas are still considered dangerous and anti-national.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;line-height: 100%;text-align: center;"><br></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;line-height: 100%;text-align: center;">What right do I have to turn 23?</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;line-height: 100%;text-align: center;">How can I face myself if everyday I walk past the suffering exploited people?</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;line-height: 100%;text-align: center;"><br></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;line-height: 100%;text-align: center;">I tell myself that physics is the most revolutionary thing to do, it raises the consciousness of people, wipes away the ways of the past. But physics on its own is not revolutionary. The discoveries of Galileo were strongly opposed by the state, but the discoveries of Einstein were used to wipe cities off the planet.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;line-height: 100%;text-align: center;"><br></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;line-height: 100%;text-align: center;">Maybe I am a coward and I will never dare to do what you did. I am scared to risk my life. I am scared of torture. Indian police broke every bone in Kishenji&rsquo;s body, unhinged his jaw, burned him, shocked his genitals, pulled out his teeth and nails, shot him many times. That is the punishment for fighting for the oppressed&rsquo;s rights in the so-called Aajad Hindustan.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;line-height: 100%;text-align: center;">I am scared to meet a similar fate.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;line-height: 100%;text-align: center;"><br></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;line-height: 100%;text-align: center;">But I shouldn&rsquo;t be. You and Che are beacons of humanity who proved that the only death worth the life is the last breath you take knowing full well that you stood up for what was right.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;line-height: 100%;text-align: center;">You refused to bow to the hegemony of the oppressor.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;line-height: 100%;text-align: center;">You give me voice, you give me strength.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;line-height: 100%;text-align: center;"><br></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;line-height: 100%;text-align: center;">I promise you comrades, I will not let you down.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;line-height: 100%;text-align: center;">A day will come when your ideas will become illegal again, and I will stand my ground.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;line-height: 100%;text-align: center;">I will defend the socialist ideal to my death.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;line-height: 100%;text-align: center;">You were a stream, we will be the river.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;line-height: 100%;text-align: center;">You were the spark, we will be the fire.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;line-height: 100%;text-align: center;"><br></p>
