                        Update (24 Sep) : The course has begun. Currently I am uploading lectures on YouTube and problems on this website; so the students can study and solve them in 
                        their own time. After everyone has solved the problems, we would meet up and I would clarify doubts etc.

                The goal of this project is teaching key concepts in Astronomy and Astrophysics through the Physics, Chemistry and Mathematics known to the students of Joint Entrance Examination (Advanced).<br>
                <br>
                Students will learn a good deal of astronomy and physics, as well as solve fun and challenging problems. JEE students will gain problem solving perception and skill.
                Scroll down to see the tentative course content and content sample. The fee and class schedule will be decided after first few classes according to the class' needs.
