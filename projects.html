            <b><h3>Detection of new variable stars from old plates</h3></b>
            I am working on the publication of 18 new variable stars which I found from the Moscow plates archives as a part of my master's project work and work I did later.

            An LLM based AI tool which which will help you finish your sentences and correct your grammar while you are speaking. It will also help you construct entire new sentences based on the conversation you are having.

            <b><h3>Multi-star systems' lightcurve simulator and physics embedded fitter</h3></b>
            Generalising the work that I did at IUCAA, I am writing a program that generates the lightcurves of stable* multi-star systems and fits it to a given lightcurve (started with the Tabby's star). The first challenge is algorithmic, to generalise the 3-star algorithm to n and make it computationally efficient and the second challenge is actually finding a star system that would create a certain lightcurve, here is where I want to employ a learner to learn the physics of stable orbits and not test for chaotic orbits.

            <b><h3>Automated CNN based lightcurve classifier</h3></b>
            Lightcurves still need to be classified into Cepheids, RR Lyra, Binary stars, Exoplanets etc; which should be done by machines now (with good accuracy, of course). I am using the Kepler data.

            Imagine if you walked into a shop, typed in your measurements, selected the fabric, style, embroidery etc; waited for a while and walked out with custom made clothes that fit you perfectly made completely by robots!
            We don't even need AI for this, just need to invent a machine.

            <b><h3>Physics embedded digital white-board</h3></b>
            A physics teacher would draw a physics problem on the digital white-board and be able to execute a real-time physics simulation as it is in the problem. For example, she can set the values of gravitational acceleration and air-drag etc and launch a projectile which shall land at the appropriate spot, hopefully calculated by the students.

            <b><h3>Sunglasses with adjustable shade</h3></b>
            I am not talking about clip-on frames. With these glasses, if the day is extra bright and you need darker sunglasses, you can simply rotate the first polariser glass and make the shade darker. When the Sun's going low, you can turn it back and more for a clearer vision. This is possible by two polariser glasses, as you must have guessed. The sunglasses will necessarily be circular in shape.

            If you don't have a motorised telescope, and you hate calibrating your finderscope; you can simply tell this raspberry pi enabled robotic laser pointer to point to the Andromeda galaxy (or any object or coordinates of interest); which you shall quickly find using your normal telescope.

            <b><h3>Stellarium for the blind</h3></b>
            While talking to a blind friend of mine, I realised he had never seen stars. Stellarium mobile has a gyroscope which it uses for its demi-AR feature. What we need to do is vibrate the phone (haptic feedback is better than acoustic, as per the blind people I spoke with) when there is a prominent star in the center, modulated with its intensity. If we are using audio then we can use frequency to indicate colour and amplitude to indicate brightness of a star. We can add many other features. People using this app will get a 3D-oriented feel of the cosmos that we can't even fathom; for us sighted people, stars disappear when they set beneath the horizon.

            <b><h3>Transliteration between indic texts</h3></b>
            I wanted to read the lyrics to a song in Bangla (Bengali) but since the Latin script has far fewer letters and sounds, I realised I can't know the actual pronunciations by reading the lyrics in the Latin script. However, most indo-Aryan languages and Dravidi languages except Tamil have very similar abugidas derived from the Sanskrut system. So we would be able to write a transliteration tool which transliterates between these languages easily. Note that we are talking about converting between scripts only, not talking about translation. We will learn a lot about unicode we will also learn all the major scripts in India.

            <b><h3>Lingua Cosmica and Deep Learning</h3></b>
            Lingua Cosmica or Lincos is a language constructed by a mathematician named Hans Freudenthal in the 60s. As the name suggests, it is intended to be used as a communication medium between alien species, particularly between humans and any extra-terrestrial intelligence we may encounter. Of course, such a task is very difficult. Prof. Freudenthal has based this language in mathematical and logical principles which we may assume to share with the aliens.<br>
            There are many possibilities here, one is creating a translation tool; from natural language like English to lincos.<br>
            More importantly, we can use AI to create an advanced language. We may treat the AI as the alien and send the language in its intended order and test if the AI is able to understand it. At the moment I am not sure whether such a task would require Artificial General Intelligence or we may be able to program GPT-4 etc to guess what we are talking about.

            <b><h3>AI mental health classifier over scribbles</h3></b>
            Visual tests such as Rorschach inkblot test, 'draw a person' etc need to be taken at face value and often rely on the expertise of the medical practioniner. It is entirely possible to create a new test and train a supervised classifier to classify people. We can start with schizophrenia, however we must be very careful while making a neural network diagnostic tool, especially since we cannot explain the weights and the biases. The goal is to see if schizophrenics draw scribbles differently.

            <b><h3>Interactive digital research papers</h3></b>
            Most people read PDFs of research papers these days and journals are all online. So we can create digital versions of the research papers which are a lot more interactive. For example, in this research paper, the reader will be able to alter the plots, download the data directly, even make their own plots in the webpage itself. We can put 3D objects or scenes in the paper instead of putting many cross sections and views.<br>
            We would need to write a markup language built on LaTeX so that anyone could write a paper like this, and it should also be available as a PDF for the old-timers. We can use Julia for the interactive web-plotting and display.
