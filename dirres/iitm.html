                            <h3>My research experience at IITM & TIFR-BARC</h3>
                            In our third semester, my friend and I joined prof. Aravind G.'s laboratory in the physics department. Here we were lab assistants, helping
                            out in lab, running around between fabrication and lab, making tools etc. <br>
                            In December of 2017 I had the opportunity to work as an assistant in a high energy molecular dynamics experiment at the TIFR-BARC <a href="https://www.tifr.res.in/~pell/pelletron/index.php">Pelletron Facility</a>.
                            Here I learned a lot about practical aspects of experimental physics. <br><br>
                            In our experiment, Carbon-Nitrogen compounds were accelerated to incredibly
                            high speeds through a series of extremely high voltage coils in a vacuum tube, then passed through a magnetic mass selector, followed by beam calibration into a chamber
                            where Argon was released. We were studying the effect of collision with Argon, the end-products would fall into a detector, where we could scan across
                            the kinetic energy with voltage, a histogram of KE for a particular mass (hence a particular CN compound out of the family) was produced on the computer.
