            Here I have gained experience in neural networks, 3D geometry/computational geometry, graph theory and GNN, robotics and IoT, computer vision, C++ and python programming and web development. <br>
            I also regularly give talks here, such as: Non-Euclidean geometry, Tensor algebra, EM Radiation for engineers etc

            When I joined I started working on computer vision problems using OpenCV. These were basically countour detections and text extraction et cetera. I then moved on to Optical Character Recognition in CAD/CAM problems. After which I was assigned to writing software for an autonomous vehicle for warehouses. I was also given in training in C++ programming (with an emphasis on object oriented programming), Geometry (3D and 2D, bezier curves, B-splines, mathematics of CAD format etc) and web development (HTML, CSS, JS). After this I was moved into the R&D department and I kept working on the autonomous intelligent vehicle which used a raspberry pi and several sensors like LIDAR, ultrasonic sensor, motor-encoder, magnetometer and gyroscope etc to function. Later I was needed in the Graph Neural Networks project, where I learned a lot of graph theory, graph neural networks, graph convolutional neural networks, neural networks and training etc in general. In our department we follow the agile scrum method with sprint plannings and everything.<br>
            <br>
            I have also given a very comprehensive 70 slides lecture on the subject of Non-Euclidean geometry. I solved a few integrals for this, the solutions of which aren't found anywhere on the internet. I have stage confidence and I am very good at teaching; hence after this I also gave talks on EM radiation and Tensor algebra.
